								Bank of America Merrill Lynch - May 2016 to December 2016 <br/><br/>
								At BAML I was part of the prime brokerage technology team where I worked on multiple projects. I primarily worked on their
								web application that managed entitlements for BAML clients and employees. I was exposed to multiple layers in their technology
								stack through projects associated with this web application, including Bootstrap, AngularJS, C#, and Oracle. I also developed a
								proof of concept for a web application using Angular Material which is to be used as the drive of future projects.<br/><br/>
								I enhanced my collaboration skills by being integrated into their SDLC. I used project tracking software (Jira), collected 
								business requirements, designed with team members, developed, tested, worked closely with QA on raised bugs, and participated in production deployment.<br/><br/>
								I also strengthened my presentation skills by presenting my proof of concept prototype to senior management discussing its benefits and providing
								recommendations for its future development.<br/><br/>
								I had the opportunity to work with amazing people during my time at BAML. I cannot appreciate enough how my team has helped me
								further develop my career.

								Christie Digital Systems Inc. - September 2015 to December 2015 <br/><br/>
								At Christie Digital, I was on the software UI team for one of their large scale projectors. Here I worked closely with several
								teams to develop new components and enhancements to the projector interface using technologies like C++, QT, and QML. I also worked on a solo side web project that made redundant tasks easy for internal employees using Bootstrap, PHP, and jQuery. <br/><br/>
								I was exposed to agile scrum methodologies while on the software UI team. I learned to be collaborative with my team members and other teams (QA, backend, UI/UX)
								by participating in daily standups, sprint planning, retrospectives, and reviews. <br/><br/>
								While working on the web application side project, I learned how to effectively gather requirements for the project and present small demos and obtain feedback. The result
								was a functional web application that automated menial tasks of internal teams. <br/><br/>
								I am satisfied with what I have learned at Christie. I met several people, all with different backgrounds in the industry while also being able to contribute to the company.

								York Region - September 2014 to December 2014 <br/><br/>
								During my time at York Region, my primary role was working on web applications under the environmental services department. I developed
								new features for existing applications and developed new applications using Oracle APEX. <br/><br/>
								One of the large projects I worked on was a key performance indicator application. During this project, I learned to work closely with
								other team members and obtain a better understanding of web technologies such as JavaScript, jQuery, PL/SQL, and Oracle. As I became more
								familiar with the technologies used, I also provided technical support to team members who were less familiar with the language. <br/><br/>
								I had the pleasure of working with smart individuals at York Region who have provided me with mentorship and essential skills required
								for future opportunities.

								Citigroup - January 2014 to April 2014 <br/>
								As an application support analyst at Citigroup, I was given personal projects, team projects and day to day tasks to help support their
								applications. I worked on program that generated graphs which display trends of issues on their servers using Clojure. I completed day to day tasks
								such as initiating daily checks on applications, and providing support to developers who want to push changes to production. I also worked on
								a web project with another intern to simplify some of the tasks the support team does using Perl and jQuery UI. <br/><br/>
								Here I became experienced with presenting by issuing demos for projects I have worked on with senior management. I also learned to work as a team and take
								charge as a leader during the development of the web application by splitting tasks, constantly discussing requirements, and providing technical support. <br/><br/>
								I am happy that Citigroup was my first experience in the professional world where I got to learn much about software development in a supportive role.
